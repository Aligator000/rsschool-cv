### summary
I started to learn programming about a year ago. I deviates significantly from everything
I have been doing so far in my life. Sometimes it is really hard but it woke up the unvisted
areas in my brain and it is being an really exciting journey.
But what I was always good at was seraching for a solutions and ways out. It turned out to be very helpful
in programming. I have been able to solve a lot of problems with a little, big help of google, my friend.
